                    The game can be played at three different "levels of difficulty":

                        <li>"Master Detective" (the most difficult)</li>
                        <li>"Sleuth" (less difficult)</li>
                        <li>"Gumshow" (least difficult)</li>

                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    One level of difficulty is chosen for each game.  At level 1 only one private question is allowed when questioning a suspect.  At level 2 the player can ask two private questions when questioning a suspect.
                    At level 3 the player is allowed to ask 3 private questions when questioning a suspect.  Private questions are explained in the "Questiong Suspects" section.

                    While Electronic Detective is great fun to play, you must fully understand the game's instructions and rules.  To help you the following is a condensed description 
                    of how the game plays.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Think of Electronic Detective as a mystery which can be solved by one person alone or by several players interacting with each other.  Currently this version is a one player game.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    The "setting" is 20 characters together in a large city. One is murdered and the remaining 19, now Suspects, flee to different parts of the city. The object of the mystery is to find
                    which one of the 19 Suspects is the Murderer.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Players use the web site interface to "grill" Suspects for two kinds of information.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    <ul>
                        <li>An <u>Alibi</u> tells where the Suspect fled and (sometimes) who else was there.</li>
                        <li><u>"Private Questions"</u> (from each Suspect's Card) provide who else was there.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Here are the pieces to the mystery.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Characters: 10 males (numbered 1-10) and 10 females (numbered 11-20). Numbers are on the Suspect Cards.</li>
                        <li>Six "places":
